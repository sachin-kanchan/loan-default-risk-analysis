# ========================
# 1. Secrets & Credentials (MOST IMPORTANT)
# ========================
# NEVER commit secret keys, passwords, or credentials.
# Use environment variables for this. Store them in a .env file.
.env
.env.*
*.env

# ========================
# 2. Python Virtual Environments
# ========================
# These are specific to your machine and can be very large.
# Always recreate them from a requirements.txt file.
.venv/
venv/
env/
.env/

# ========================
# 3. Python Byte-compiled / Optimized Files
# ========================
# These are temporary files Python creates to run your code faster.
# They are generated automatically and don't need to be tracked.
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class

# ========================
# 4. IDE & Editor Configuration
# ========================
# These files store your personal editor settings and are not
# relevant to the project code itself.
.vscode/
.idea/
*.sublime-project
*.sublime-workspace

# ========================
# 5. macOS & Windows System Files
# ========================
# OS-specific metadata and temporary files.
.DS_Store
._*
.AppleDouble
.LSOverride
.Trashes
.Spotlight-V100
Thumbs.db

# ========================
# 6. Build, Distribution & Packaging
# ========================
# Artifacts created when you build or package your project.

# 7. Jupyter Notebook Checkpoints
# ========================
# Jupyter creates checkpoints for recovery; they don't need to be tracked.

# ========================
# 8. Log, Report & Output Files
# ========================
# Generated output files that are not part of the source code.
*.log
*.out
*.html

# ========================
# 9. Large Data Files (!!! IMPORTANT !!!)
# ========================
# Git is designed for code, not large data files. Committing large datasets
# will make your repository slow and bloated.
# Instead, include a link to the data source in your README.md.
#
# ** UNCOMMENT THE LINE BELOW FOR MOST PROJECTS **
# *.csv
# *.json
# *.xml
# *.parquet
# *.pkl
# *.pickle
# *.joblib
